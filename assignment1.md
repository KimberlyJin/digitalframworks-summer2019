How has the Chinese American community evolved geographically in the U.S. for the past century?

Today Chinese American make up the largest Asian population in the U.S. totalling 3.79 million. Chinese immigrants first flocked to the U.S. in the 1850s, escaping the economic chaos in China and chasing the gold rush in California. In 1960s, Chinese started to arrive in the U.S. in huge numbers both legally and illegally. They began with clustering around major gateway cities like Los Angeles and New York, but recently have been moving towards suburban areas and the Sun Belt region.

* Clarify and accuracy: 4
The story is written in a very clear way. The key point “Asian American moving to hi-tech suburbs” is stated in the headline and all data and reports are cited with links to original sources. One question I have regarding the story is that it portrays Asian American as a relatively homogenous group. Not all Asian American fit into the stereotype of “best-educated” and “high-income.” And it didn’t differentiate Asian American from Chinese American by using “Chinatown” in the headline. 
* Quality: 3
The story cites some good data and interprets the trend of Asian American moving towards suburb areas insightfully. But it squeezes too many data into the story than the amount a reader can digest and memorize. One way to make it easier for readers to make sense of is to visualize the findings by a map, marking out the directions Asian American are moving to and the population change among different regions. 
* Type and color: 2
The story lacks an artistic design to make it better. It follows a normal text story format with no special adjustment on presentation. No special font or color choice. 
* Creativity: 2
The story doesn’t have any creative element in terms of presentation.

What can we learn from D.C. bikeshare data?

Capital Bikeshare, a Washington, D.C. based bikeshare company which owns over 4,300 bikes and 500 stations, releases their customers’ trip history data online and accessible to the public.  I wonder how the dataset can reveal people’s commute habit, city’s transportation and infrastructure system, and any variation overtime.

I think the story did a great job in helping readers understand the map. it explains where the data comes from and makes sense of the meaning of each map. Although I do want to see more of a big picture on how all London riders move. 
* Quality: 4
I think the story is nicely done. But it didn’t focus on the dataset itself but raised the concern on potential exploitation of the data. 
* Type and color: 4
I like the way the map is designed – color to distinguish round trip and single trip, thickness of the line to indicate frequency of trips, and circle to represent the rider’s location. It is very clear and straightforward but is able to deliver the complicated message of the rider’s movement.  
* Creativity: 4
I very enjoy the creative way to present the data in the story. I think it’s one of a kind to combine map with people’s ride history. And I love how it breaks the data down by different layers of the same map and helps readers gradually comprehend the map.
