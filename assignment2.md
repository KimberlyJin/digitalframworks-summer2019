“Trump” is among the most frequently mentioned words by candidates in the 2020 Democratic Debate. 
I wonder how many times they mentioned it, who likes to mention "Trump" the most, and which topic solicits the most frequent mentioning of "Trump."

Here are factors I’ll be collecting:
* Name of Candidate 
* The topic - what question they are answering to when they mention Trump
* Which debate
* Date of debate

I will collect data by using the search function on [the transcript of their debate.](https://time.com/5615358/2020-first-democratic-debate-transcript/)

The table is [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IlC79sEBOZyba5zY09BBu51-0xoXwG2Cyz453Nng0Qk/edit?usp=sharing)
